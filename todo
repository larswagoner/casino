(- Figuring out the table and center.

- Dealing for rounds 2-12

- Game logic


- error checking

figure out build, take, collect, play buttons (must play min one card)

- redo implementation more carefully
    - add center class (center -> class.list)
    - get rid of isCollect to just isBuilt
    - make collect and build
        - still don't know why not built doesn't work 
    - discard pile wasn't working in previous version
    - finish pretty print lol
